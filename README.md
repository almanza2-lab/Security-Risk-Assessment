# Security risk assessment report


## Part 1: Select up to three hardening tools and methods to implement

Three recommended tools and methods to implement are: Multi Factor authentication, stronger password policies, and regular firewall maintenance.

  
MFA requires users to use more than one way to identify and verify their credentials before accessing an application. Some MFA methods include fingerprint scans, ID cards, pin numbers, and passwords. 

  
Strong password policies can include: rules regarding password length, a list of acceptable characters, and a disclaimer to discourage password sharing. They can also include rules surrounding unsuccessful login attempts, such as the user losing access to the network after five unsuccessful attempts. 

  
Regular firewall maintenance would mean regularly checking and updating firewall security configurations to protect against future threats.

## Part 2: Explain your recommendations

Multi Factor authentication will help against brute force attacks, which can lead to data breaches such as the one experienced.  This is something that can be done once and maintained as needed. This will help by requiring more than one step to verify the user information and will protect from threat actors who may attempt a brute force attack by simply guessing passwords. 

Stricter password policies are also needed.  Specifically, rules should be set in place to present employees from sharing passwords and from using default passwords for admins.  These are also things that will be set up once and maintained as needed. By disallowing the sharing of passwords, the likelihood of a brute force attack is minimized and the companyâ€™s security posture is hardened.  Likewise, by requiring admins to regularly change their passwords and follow certain rules for their passwords this will also help mitigate the threat of brute force attacks. These suggestions will make it harder for threat actors to guess passwords.
